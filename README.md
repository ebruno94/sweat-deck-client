# SWEAT DECK
#### WILL YOU PLAY? OR WILL YOU FOLD?

#### By **Ernest Bruno for SweatDeck Company (visit them at www.mysweatdeck.com)**

## Description

A website / program that lets users create their own account in order to use the SweatDeck™. This program allows the user to pick a card from the deck and perform the workout circuit on the selected card. While the user is working out, the program will keep track of the time it takes until the user presses the stop button. The user will also have the ability to save the workout into his/her workout history for viewing later on.


## Setup/Installation Requirements

This repo is a public repo of the Sweat Deck app I created. This is just the front-end, and the back-end will always remain private.

If you want to see the app, please visit: https://fd-sweat-deck.herokuapp.com


## Known Bugs

* The deck of cards / card is not visible when first logging in and viewing /deck route, and the user must interact with two of the buttons shown in the app: user info button on top left, random button in order to see the card. Alternatively, the user can also nudge the window size by a bit and it will also cause the cards to appear.
